Placeholder readme. something better will be added here in the future!
Remake of "flame's land ignited", Developed by FrostC (gfx, coding, level design) and rodirodude (composer, concept artist)

FLRI aims to be a speedy platformer with insperation taken from Pizza tower, megaman, Sonic 3, and more. 

The 1.0 version will have 5 levels along with a bossfight, with possible more content being added in the future. i want to keep the scope for this game fairly small so i can actually complete it. 
Not only was i not too talented when creating the original FLI, the scope for the game was way too large. 3 playable characters, 5 worlds, and a DLC with an entire new set of levels with 2 new playable
characters to go along with it.
